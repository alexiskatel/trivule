## Adding a new rule to Trivule

### Step 1

A Trivule rule is simply a callback function that handles validation according to your needs and must return a boolean value. It should implement the `RuleCallBack` interface defined in `./src/contracts/rule-callback.ts`.

Based on the type of data your callback will validate, you should categorize it under one of the following files:

- `./src/rules` (global, number, phone, string, date, file, etc.)

Here's an example implementation of a callback for the `in` rule:

```ts
/**
 * Checks if the input is in the specified list.
 *
 * @param input - The input to be checked.
 * @param params - The list of values to check against. Comma-separated string.
 * @returns `true` if the input is in the list, `false` otherwise.
 */
export const inInput: RuleCallBack = (input, params) => {
  if (!params) {
    throwEmptyArgsException("in");
  }
  const list = splitParam(params as string);
  return list.includes(input);
};
```

Explanation:

1. The first argument, `input`, corresponds to the current value of the field to be validated. It can be of types such as `string`, `Blob`, `File`, `number`, `null`, `boolean`, `undefined`, `FileList`.
2. The second argument, `params`, corresponds to the possible arguments. The arguments are comma-separated strings. You can individually retrieve them using the `splitParam` function.
   For example, if you have an HTML field like this:

```html
<input data-tr-rules="in:active, inactive, suspended" />
```

The values after the colon (`:`) are the parameters. In this case, the second argument would be a string like `"active, inactive, suspended"`. You can use the `splitParam(params ?? "")` function to get an array of individual values, for example, `['active', 'inactive', 'suspended']`.

3. The rest of the code represents the logic of the callback. In this example, we check if the current value of the field is in the specified list and return the result.

**_The callback must return a boolean value._**

#### Naming Convention

As a general convention, it is recommended to give the callback the same name as the rule you want to add. However, this is not mandatory if it causes any issues.

In this example, the rule name is normally `in`, but we had to use `inInput` because the keyword `in` is reserved in JavaScript/TypeScript.

### Step 2: Test the callback

Once you have written your callback, you need to test it to ensure that it works as expected. For this, you can use the Jest testing tool.

Depending on the file where you wrote your callback, you need to go to the corresponding test file to write your test. In this example, the test file is `global.test.ts`.

Here's an example test for the `inInput` callback:

```ts
describe("inInput rule callback", () => {
  it("should return true if the input is in the list", () => {
    const input = "active";
    const params = "active, inactive, suspended";
    const result = inInput(input, params);
    expect(result).toBe(true);
  });

  it("should return false if the input is not in the list", () => {
    const input = "pending";
    const params = "active, inactive, suspended";
    const result = inInput(input, params);
    expect(result).toBe(false);
  });

  it("should throw an error if the params argument is empty", () => {
    const input = "active";
    const params = "";
    expect(() => inInput(input, params)).toThrow();
  });
});
```

You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

Once your tests pass successfully, you can proceed to the next step.

### Step 3: Add the callback to the rules

All Trivule rules are listed in the `Rule` type, which can be found in the `./src/contracts/rule.ts` file. You need to add your rule to this type for it to be recognized.

Here's an example of adding the `in` rule:

```ts
/**
 * List of Trivule rules grouped by Rule type
 */
export type Rule = "contains" | "in" | "startWithLetter" /*...*/;
```

This also enables auto-completion in your code editor, but it's not the primary purpose of adding the rule to this type.

If you're using a good TypeScript-aware tool, you may notice an error in the `./src/validation/tr-bag.ts` file. This file is where the rules are actually added to Trivule. Until a rule is added to this file, it won't be part of Trivule.

In this file, the `TrBag` class is used to store the rules. You need to add your rule to the `rules` attribute of this class, like this:

```typescript
export class TrBag implements ITrBag {
  private static rules: RulesBag = {
    in: inInput,
  };
}
```

### Step 4: Assign a message

In general, your rule is ready to be used once you have added it. However, you also need to assign a message to the rule. Otherwise, a default message will be used.

To do this, you need to go to the `./src/local/lang` folder. There, you will find the two default languages supported by Trivule (English and French). You need to add the messages corresponding to your rule in these files.

Here's an example of adding messages for the `in` rule:

```ts
export const en_messages: RulesMessages = {
  default: "This field is invalid",
  in: "Please choose a correct value for the :field field",
};
```

You should do the same for the French language.

If you have followed these steps correctly, you can test your rule by using it in an HTML form to see if everything works correctly.

### Summary of the steps:

#### Step 1: Write the rule callback

Here's an example code to write the `in` rule callback:

```typescript
import {
  RuleCallBack,
  spliteParam,
  throwEmptyArgsException,
} from "../validation/trivule";

/**
 * Check if the input value is in the specified list.
 * @param input - The current value of the field to validate. It can be of types such as `string`, `Blob`, `File`, `number`, `null`, `boolean`, `undefined`, `FileList`.
 * @param params - The list of values to check against. Comma-separated string.
 * @returns `true` if the input is in the list, `false` otherwise.
 */
export const inInput: RuleCallBack = (input, params) => {
  if (!params) {
    throwEmptyArgsException("in");
  }
  const list = spliteParam(params as string);
  return list.includes(input);
};
```

#### Step 2: Test the callback with Jest tests

Here's an example test for the `inInput` callback:

```typescript
import { inInput } from "../src/validation/rules/inInput";

describe("inInput rule callback", () => {
  it("should return true if the input is in the list", () => {
    const input = "active";
    const params = "active, inactive, suspended";
    const result = inInput(input, params);
    expect(result).toBe(true);
  });

  it("should return false if the input is not in the list", () => {
    const input = "pending";
    const params = "active, inactive, suspended";
    const result = inInput(input, params);
    expect(result).toBe(false);
  });

  it("should throw an error if params argument is empty", () => {
    const input = "active";
    const params = "";
    expect(() => inInput(input, params)).toThrow();
  });
});
```

#### Step 3: Add the callback to the Rule type

In the `./src/contracts/rule.ts` file, add the `in` rule to the `Rule` type:

```typescript
export type Rule = "contains" | "in" | "startWithLetter";
```

#### Step 4: Add the callback to the TrBag class

In the `./src/validation/tr-bag.ts` file, add the `inInput` rule to the `rules` attribute of the `TrBag` class:

```typescript
import { inInput } from "./rules/inInput";

export class TrBag implements ITrBag {
  private static rules: RulesBag = {
    contains: contains,
    in: inInput,
  };
}
```

#### Step 5: Assign a message to the rule

In the language files `./src/locale/lang`, assign a message to the `in` rule for each supported language. Here's an example for English and French languages:

```typescript
// ./src/local/lang/en.ts
export const en_messages: RulesMessages = {
  default: "This field is invalid",
  contains: "The :field field must contain the value ':arg0'",
  in: "Please choose a correct value for the :field field",
};
```

Once you have completed these steps, you can push your changes and create a Pull Request to contribute to the project.
